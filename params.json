{"name":"Read { me }","tagline":"Felix Gläske","body":"## Who am I?\r\nMy name is Felix and I’m a mid twenty software engineer from Berlin. I recently finished my Bachelor of Science in *Applied computer science*. I love writing software for many years and I’m willing to intensify this relationship with upcoming challenges.  \r\nI’m also **willing to relocate** to interesting places or for interesting projects!\r\n\r\n## Status\r\nAvailable for hire!\r\n\r\n## What have I done?\r\n* Implemented DHCP & server in JavaScript/node.js (Bachelor thesis)\r\n* System Architecture, DevOps & application development at [Performates](http://performates.de)\r\n* API & Application development at [Semigator](http://semigator.de) (PHP/CodeIgniter/AngularJS)\r\n* Guy for everything at [ByteFM](http://byte.fm) (server administration, development, maintenance)\r\n* Building an internal time tracking solution at [Ampelmann](http://ampelmann.de) (PHP/CodeIgniter)\r\n\r\n## What I want to do!\r\nCurrently I’m very interested in extending my skills in the DevOps field. I like to convert complex requirements into working system solutions. Especially [docker](http://docker.io) got me on the hook right now.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to developing applications I’ve got 5 years of experience in PHP. Most of the time with [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter) and currently I love to work with [Laravel](http://laravel.io).\r\n\r\nMy strength and passion can definitely be found in dealing with abstract/technically problems rather than in visual stuff.\r\nI also like to contribute to open-source projects (and of course make use of them) because I like the idea that code written by my hands runs through different systems and transports data to make the life easier for people using it.\r\n\r\n## What I **don’t** want to do!\r\nI do lack profession in terms of design/colours/proportions… so CSS or Photoshop stuff is **not** the right work for me.\r\n\r\n## What I offer\r\n* PHP development\r\n* JavaScript development (node.js)\r\n* experience with SQL and NoSQL databases\r\n* System architecture\r\n* Server maintenance\r\n* Being between system administrator and developer or so called DevOps\r\n* **Accepting new challenges**\r\n\r\n## Social\r\n* [Blog](http://felixglaeske.de)\r\n* [Github](https://github.com/soupdiver)\r\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/soupdiver)\r\n* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/soupdiver)\r\n* [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Felix_Glaeske)\r\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=263748960)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
