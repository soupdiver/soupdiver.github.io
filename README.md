## Who am I?
My name is Felix and I’m a mid twenty software engineer from Berlin. I recently finished my Bachelor of Science in *Applied computer science*. I love writing software for many years and I’m willing to intensify this relationship with upcoming challenges.  
I’m also **willing to relocate** to interesting places or for interesting projects!

## Status
Available for hire!

## What have I done?
* Implemented DHCP & server in JavaScript/node.js (Bachelor thesis)
* System Architecture, DevOps & application development at [Performates](http://performates.de)
* API & Application development at [Semigator](http://semigator.de) (PHP/CodeIgniter/AngularJS)
* Guy for everything at [ByteFM](http://byte.fm) (server administration, development, maintenance)
* Building an internal time tracking solution at [Ampelmann](http://ampelmann.de) (PHP/CodeIgniter)

## What I want to do!
Currently I’m very interested in extending my skills in the DevOps field. I like to convert complex requirements into working system solutions. Especially [docker](http://docker.io) got me on the hook right now.

When it comes to developing applications I’ve got 5 years of experience in PHP. Most of the time with [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter) and currently I love to work with [Laravel](http://laravel.io).

My strength and passion can definitely be found in dealing with abstract/technically problems rather than in visual stuff.
I also like to contribute to open-source projects (and of course make use of them) because I like the idea that code written by my hands runs through different systems and transports data to make the life easier for people using it.

## What I **don’t** want to do!
I do lack profession in terms of design/colours/proportions… so CSS or Photoshop stuff is **not** the right work for me.

## What I offer
* PHP development
* JavaScript development (node.js)
* experience with SQL and NoSQL databases
* System architecture
* Server maintenance
* Being between system administrator and developer or so called DevOps
* **Accepting new challenges**
